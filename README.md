# ML-Projects-Portfolio-House-Price-Prediction
## Project Overview
This project predicts house prices using machine learning models. It demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Dataset
- The dataset is not included in this repository due to size.
- Download Source: [Kaggle House Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
- After downloading, place the Train and Test CSV files in the `data/` folder for the notebook to run.
- Description: Contains house attributes (square footage, year built, neighbourhood location, sale prices, etc.)

## Skills & Tools
- Python: Pandas, NumPy
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Underfitting and Overfitting, Random Forest)
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Git/GitHub for version control
- Jupyter Notebook for workflow documentation

## Features & Preprocessing
- Handling missing data
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling/normalization
- Train/test split for model evaluation

## Models & Evaluation
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Metrics: RMSE, RÂ² score
- Visualizations: Predicted vs Actual prices

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/House-Price-Prediction-ML.git
